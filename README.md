# 🎭 Playwright Automation Project

This project is an end-to-end UI automation framework built using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), designed to test key features of a web-based chatbot application. The framework is structured using the **Page Object Model (POM)** to ensure maintainability, scalability, and reusability of code.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

### ✅ Install Node.js

Download and install the latest stable version of Node.js from the official site:
👉 [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

You can verify the installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```


## 🛠️ Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Playwright

```bash
npm init -y
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

This installs:

* Playwright test runner
* All required browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit)

### 3. Install Faker for Dynamic Test Data

```bash
npm install @faker-js/faker
```

## 📌 Features

🔹 **Page Object Model (POM)** for modular and reusable code
🔹 Test cases grouped by functionality (Chatbot, Hamburger Menu)
🔹 Dynamic data using `faker` to simulate real user input
🔹 CI/CD Integration using YAML pipeline to send test reports to the client

---

🚀 Run Tests

## Headless Mode (default)

```bash
npx playwright test tests --workers=1
```

## Headed Mode (for debugging)

```bash
npx playwright test tests --workers=1 --headed
```

---

## 📤 CI/CD Pipeline

A `pipeline.yml` file is included for integration with your CI/CD tool (like GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, etc.). It’s configured to:

* Run tests automatically on every push
* Generate Playwright HTML reports
* Send reports to the client via pre-configured actions

---

## 📄 Reports

After a test run, Playwright generates an HTML report. To open the latest report locally:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
